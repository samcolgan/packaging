## Introduction

The purpose of the `packaging` package is to join four common functions
used in statistical prediction and inference within a single package. These 
functions are `my_t.test`, which conducts a simply hypothesis test; 
`my_lm`, which produces a linear regression model; `my_knn_cv`, which
finds the cross-validation misclassification error of a k-nearest neighbors 
model; and `my_rf_cv`, which finds the cross-validation misclassification
error of a random forest model for the `palmerpenguins` dataset.

To install and access the function from GitHub, perform the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("samcolgan/packaging")
library(packaging)
```

```{r setup}
# Load packaging
library(packaging)
```
## Using `my_t.test`

To demonstrate the uses of the t-test function, it may be helpful to conduct a 
few hypothesis tests with the `gapminder` dataset, which is included in
this package as `my_gapminder`.

```{r}
# Load packaging and tidyverse
library(packaging)
library(tidyverse)

# Test if the true average life expectancy is not equal to 60.
my_t.test(my_gapminder$lifeExp, mu = 60, alternative = "two.sided")

```

Using a p_value of 0.05, we cannot reject the null that the true average life expectancy equals 60. 

```{r}
# Test if the true average life expectancy is less than 60.
my_t.test(my_gapminder$lifeExp, mu = 60, alternative = "less")
```

Using a p_value of 0.05, we can reject the null that the true average life 
expectancy equals 60. We can rule in favor of the alternative that the true average life expectancy is less than 60.

```{r}
# Test if the true average life expectancy in this dataset is greater than 60.
my_t.test(my_gapminder$lifeExp, mu = 60, alternative = "greater")
```

Using a p_value of 0.05, we cannot reject the null that the true average life 
expectancy equals 60. We cannot rule in favor of the alternative that the true average life expectancy is greater than 60.

## Using `my_lm`

To demonstrate the uses of the `my_lm` function, it may be helpful to conduct a
linear regression with the `gapminder` dataset, which is included in this package as `my_gapminder`.

```{r}
# Modeling lifeExp with gdpPercap and continent
lifeExp_lm <- my_lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap + continent, my_gapminder)
lifeExp_lm

# Fitted values
mod_fits <- fitted(lifeExp_lm)
my_df <- data.frame("actual" = my_gapminder$lifeExp, "fitted" = mod_fits)

# Actual vs. fitted values
fitted_plot <- ggplot(my_df, 
                      # Fitted on x-axis, actual on y-axis
                      aes(x = fitted, y = actual)) +
  # Scatterplot
  geom_point() +
  # 45-degree line
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, col = "red", lty = 2) + 
  # Font sizing
  theme_bw(base_size = 15) +
  # Axes
  labs(x = "Fitted values", y = "Actual values", title = "Actual vs. Fitted") +
  # Title size and spacing
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

# Show plot
fitted_plot
```

The `gdpPercap` coefficient reveals how much `lifeExp` increases for a one-value increase in `gdpPercap`. If the p_value for this coefficient is below
0.05, then we should reject the null that gdpPercap has no effect on lifeExp and maintain the coefficient in our model.

I am intentionally not commenting on the interpretation of the actual vs. fitted values plot because there is a structural flaw in the code for the `my_lm` function that inhibits this analysis

## Using `my_knn_cv`

To demonstrate the uses of the `my_knn_cv` function, it may be helpful to
conduct a series of k-nearest neighbors classifications and record the
cross-validation misclassification rates for `k_nn` equals 1 through 10
neighbors. The example below uses the `palmerpenguins` dataset, which is
included in this package as `my_penguins`. The goal is to compare the CV
misclassification rate (5 folds) with the training misclassification rate for
each of the ten prediction sets.

```{r}
# Load class package
library(class)

# Remove missing observations
my_penguins <- na.omit(my_penguins)

# Training data
penguin_train <- data.frame("bill_length_mm" = my_penguins$bill_length_mm,
                            "bill_depth_mm" = my_penguins$bill_depth_mm,
                            "flipper_length" = my_penguins$flipper_length_mm,
                            "body_mass_g" = my_penguins$body_mass_g)

# Penguin class information                   
penguin_cl <- my_penguins$species

# Create empty vector to store CV errors
cv <- c(rep(NA, 10))

# Create empty list with 10 objects to store class predictions for training 
# error
pred_class <- vector(mode = "list", length = 10)

# Create empty vector to store training errors
train <- c(rep(NA, 10))

# Iterate from 1:10 to compare cv and training error
for (i in 1:10) {
  cv[i] <- my_knn_cv(penguin_train, penguin_cl, i, 5)$cv_err
  pred_class[[i]] <- knn(penguin_train, penguin_train, penguin_cl, k = i)
  train[i] <- mean(pred_class[[i]] != penguin_cl)
}

# Compare errors in table
error_table <- tibble("CV error" = cv,
                    "Train error" = train)

error_table
```

Based on the CV misclassification rate, I would choose the model with 
`k_nn` = 1 nearest neighbor because this model produces the lowest CV 
error. Based on the training error, I would also choose the model with 
`k_nn` = 1 nearest neighbor because this model produces the lowest 
training error. 

In practice, it is better to choose the model based on CV error because 
cross-validation is determining the test error, which does a better job at 
evaluating the predictive capacity of the model than training error. 
Cross-validation amounts to the process of dividing the data into folds, 
simulating new data by predicting the class values of one of the folds from the
classes of the other folds, calculating the misclassification rate, repeating 
the process for each fold, and averaging the misclassification rates across all
test folds to find the cross-validation error. Thus, cross-validation does a 
good job of finding models that will be effective at predicting the class of
new data.

## Using `my_rf_cv`

To demonstrate the uses of the `my_rf_cv` function, it may be helpful to
repeat a series of random forest predictions and record the average
cross-validation misclassification rates for `k` equals 2, 5, and 10
folds. The random forest function in this package has hardwired the
`my_penguins` dataset, and will predict `body_mass_g` using
covariates `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, and
`flipper_length_mm`. The goal is to compare the CV misclassification rates
for 2, 5, and 10 folds. 

```{r}
# Load randomForest package
library(randomForest)
library(kableExtra)

# Create empty vectors to store CV MSE's
cv2 <- c(rep(NA, 30))
cv5 <- c(rep(NA, 30))
cv10 <- c(rep(NA, 30))

# CV estimated MSE errors for 2, 5, and 10 folds. Run each function 30 times.
for (i in 1:30) {
  cv2[i] <- my_rf_cv(2)
  cv5[i] <- my_rf_cv(5)
  cv10[i] <- my_rf_cv(10)
}

# Data frame of CV errors and fold number
CVerr_data <- data.frame("cv_err" = c(cv2, cv5, cv10),
                        "fold" = c(rep("02", 30), rep("05", 30), rep("10", 30)))

# Create boxplot to compare CV error distributions
CVerr_plot <- ggplot(CVerr_data,
                    # Fold # on x-axis, cv_err on y-axis
                    aes(x = fold, y = cv_err)) +
  # Boxplot
  geom_boxplot(fill = "violet") +
  # Title and axes
  labs(title = "CV errors by number of folds",
       x = "# of folds", y = "CV error") +
  # Font sizing
  theme_bw(base_size = 16) +
  # Title size and spacing
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16)) 

# Show plot
CVerr_plot


# Table of means and standard deviations
CVerror_table <- data.frame("Mean" = c(mean(cv2), mean(cv5), mean(cv10)),
                            "St_Dev" = c(sd(cv2), sd(cv5), sd(cv10)))

# Add rownames
row.names(CVerror_table) <- c("2_Folds", "5_Folds", "10_Folds") 

# Format
kable_styling(kable(CVerror_table))
```

The boxplot and the table demonstrate two consistent results, namely, that the
mean and standard deviation of the CV error decrease as the number of folds
increases. Albeit, the mean and standard deviation decrease at a diminishing
rate. This is likely the case because as the number of folds increases, each
fold will comprise a smaller share of the data. Thus, for each set of
predictions, a greater percentage of the data will be used as training data
while a smaller percentage of the data will be used as test data. The
opportunity for error decreases and so the average cross-validation error will
decrease as well.
